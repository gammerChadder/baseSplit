# BaseSplit — Smart, Transparent Expense Sharing on Base

BaseSplit is a decentralized, AI-powered expense tracking and splitting platform built on the Base Chain. It helps groups of people split bills, settle expenses in stablecoins like USDC, and gain intelligent insights into their financial behavior — all with low fees and high transparency.

## 🧩 Problem

Splitting expenses is a common necessity among friends, roommates, travel companions, and families. However, most existing solutions are:

- Centralized and non-transparent  
- Expensive to use due to high transaction fees (especially on L1 chains)  
- Lacking in smart features for budgeting, categorization, or insights  
- Not built for stable, scalable, or trustless environments  

This leaves users with limited control over their data, high costs, and no clear picture of how they spend.
